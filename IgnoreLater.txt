Will git ignore this document later?

Observation:
1. The file was not moved to staging area if it was mentioned in .gitignore file
2. If the .gitignore file is modified after the document was moved to staging area, changes wont be reflected.
3. Checking if these observations are added by Pull request on CLI.
