Will git ignore this document later?

Observation:
1. The file was not moved to staging area if it was mentioned in .gitignore file
2. If the .gitignore file is modified after the document was moved to staging area, changes wont be reflected.
3. Checking if these contents are added by Pull request on CLI.
    Obs:
	The contents added through github were pulled and modified on desktop through CLI.
	a. Verify if these changes will be updated, since .gitignore file had this document included to be ignored.
	Obs: 
	    The changes were considered by git, even if this doc was included in .gitignore
